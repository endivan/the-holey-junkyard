Things to be done:

1. Hitting 'Cancel' on client dialog boxes prompts for exiting the application,
but if the user cancels the exit, ...? This should be handled properly. Also,
the voter should not be able to exit midway through the voting process.

2. Security is a major concern. The best option is to use an encrypted
connection to the server and building more guards into the server-side variables
and methods.

3. Safety of votes: server crashes should be handled gracefully. Incrementing
the votes on the server should be an atomic operation; i.e. the votes from all
steps of the voting process should be incremented together.

4. Multi-tiered servers (long-term goal)

5. Customizability of application title, header line (users probably want the
name and logo of their organizations there), etc.
