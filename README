This is the README file located in the top directory of the repository. The
directory has four sub-directories and one file, which are explained below:

Directories --
AVR/
    This directory contains built AVR microcontroller C code, with
    documentation. It is designed to work on the ATmega8 and the ATmega8535
    microcontrollers. The code demonstrates simple microcontroller operation,
    and a few sub-directories contain specific projects.

python/
    This directory contains Python code. It includes utilities which we have
    written in the Python language for various small purposes. There are no
    specific projects.

VoteCounter/
    This directory contains Java code for a vote counting system.
    This project has been moved to SourceForge with the same name.

nirmal_nagri/
    This directory contains code written for a programming competition. The code
    has been made with one goal in mind - to make the city a clean and 'smart'
    place.

mathinator/
    This directory contains Python code for a simple word problem solver.
    This project has been moved to SourceForge with the same name and is still
    under development.

befunge/
    This directory contains random programs and snippets in the 'befunge'
    language (a 2D esoteric language).

wacs/
    This directory contains code written for a programming competition. The code
    in this directory aims to help improve women and child safety. (TODO: rename
    this directory to a better name)

other/
    Oddball directory containing very random stuff. Includes misc. bash scripts,
    3D models, videos, songs, scribble files, etc.
